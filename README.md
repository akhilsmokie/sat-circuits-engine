# SAT Circuits Synthesis Engine

This Qiskit-based program builds and runs quantum circuits for satisfiability problems according to user-defined constraints. The circuits being generated by the program are based on [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) and its [amplitude amplification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude_amplification) sub-routine.

## Motivation

Today's current quantum software stack is pretty thin. Quantum programming is being performed mostly at the level of qubits and logic gates.  While for low amounts of qubits it might be sufficient, as technology advances and quantum processors scale up it becomes infeasible to design quantum programs and algorithms for increasing amounts of qubits.  Some adequate layers of abstraction are needed to really exploit the power of future's quantum computers.

## Intention

This program is a proof-of-concept for automatic quantum program synthesis. While it provides a layer of automation, still there are many aspects that are not covered (yet) by the engine - Such as extensive circuit depth optimization, hardware specifications, etc.

## Instructions
1. All the necessary files are in the main folder.
2. I would recommend downloading the entire directory ('Code -> Download ZIP' on the main page) and then running it on a Jupyter Notebook. Run the main.ipynb file and further instructions are included within it. No need to run anything but the main file.
3. In the file [test_data.txt](https://github.com/ohadlev77/SAT_Circuits_Engine/blob/main/test_data.txt) there are few tested examples that can be used easily, for convenience.


## Functionality

### User's Input:

 1. The total amount of input qubits - $n$ qubits create a $2^n$ search space.
 2. A string of boolean arithmetic constraints involving the input qubits (see more [here](https://github.com/ohadlev77/SAT_Circuits_Engine/blob/main/constraints_format.txt "constraints_format.txt")).
3. The expected amount of results. If the expected amount of results is unknown, the program can handle this using a variation of the method described in [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605034) (section 4). According to the original method once a single marked value is obtained then we halt, with a possibility to repeat the process many times. We chose to run a given circuit that yields a marked state X times, such that if we get marked values in all X times then this circuit might be the optimal circuit or near optimal. Then we run the circuit many times (according to user's input) in hope to reveal all the marked values.

### The Program's output:
1. A `QuantumCircuit` object that solves the SAT problem.
2. A basic representation of the results obtained by running the circuit.

## Future Improvements Needed

1. Further improvement of the robustness to the case where the amount of marked elements is unknown, using weak measurememnts / damping techniques. 
2. Further optimizing  of $MCX$ gates cost.
3. Adding more supported constraints (addition operators between qubits, comparison of qubits and integers, etc).
4. Adding more optimization parameters - Such as maximum amount of qubits available, maximum desired circuit depth, maximum allowed amount of $CX$ gates, etc.
