The format of the constraints string we use is of the form: '(__CONSTRAINT 1__),(__CONSTRAINT 2__),...,(__CONSTRAINT N__)'.
Each '(__CONSTRAINT x__)' block is of the format: '(__LEFT_OPERAND__ __OPERATOR__ __RIGHT_OPERAND__)'.
The currently supported operators are: "==" and "!=".
The currently supported operands are bundles of qubits indexes (1 qubit or more) - Each qubit index should be written within a '[]'.
The qubit numbering convention we use is Little-Endian (the MSB is on the left side and the LSB is on the right side).

An example for a valid constraints string (3 constraints in that single string): '([0] == [5]),([3][2] != [5][4]),([6][5][4] == [1])'.
Examples of invalid strings: '1 == [5]', '([3] = [2]),(3 != 2)',...
No need for quotes ('') when entering the string to the program.
